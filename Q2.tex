A 3-CNF formula is a formula in CNF in which every clause contains at most 3 literals.\\

Consider the propositional formula  $E =$  ``$(((P \text{ OR } Q) \text{ OR } R) \text{ OR } \text{NOT}(S))$''.\\


Explain why there is no 3-CNF formula containing only the variables $P, Q, R$, and $S$
that is logically equivalent to $E$.\\\\\\

To convert $E$ into 3-CNF, we need to distribute the OR operations over the AND oprations, but becasue $E$ has no AND operations, we cannot do this. So, since changing $E$ to a CNF formula will either change the logical value, or has a clause containing more than 3 literals, therefore we conclude that there is no 3-CNF formula containing only the variables $P, Q, R$, and $S$ that is logically equivalent to $E$, as needed.
